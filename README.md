Collection of personal notes. Caveat emptor if you use this for your exams, or, heaven forbid, clinical practice.

!How this website works
These notes are powered by [[Tiddlywiki|classic.tiddlywiki.com/]], a wiki-style way of organising. It is built around the search function and tags - hence each segment of notes is tagged. I've also tried to link sections to each other to avoid it becoming like a textbook.

!Main sources
BMJ Best Practice, NICE guidelines, LITFL, OHCM. Links to external resources such as specific guidelines, podcasts and articles given below the main body.
