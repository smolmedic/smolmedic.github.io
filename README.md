# smolmedic.github.io

Collection of personal notes. Caveat emptor if you use this for your exams, or, heaven forbid, clinical practice.

## How this website works
These notes are powered by [Tiddlywiki](tiddlywiki.com), a wiki-style notebook system similar in thought (at least in my view) to [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de). It is built around the search function, tags and links between sections. The intention is to be able to integrate the same information in different ways (e.g. clinical presentation, pathophysiology, prescribing/pharmacology). 

## Main sources
BMJ Best Practice, NICE guidelines, LITFL, OHCM. Links to external resources such as specific guidelines, podcasts and articles given below the main body.

## Can I add something?
It's Github, so sure! Anyone can edit, but you'll need to save it locally, then add as a new branch and there's a good chance you already knew that if you're regularly on Github.
